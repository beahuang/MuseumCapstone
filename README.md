# Interaction Team Degree Project: Museum Mobile App

## Software Prerequisites
* Git
  * Comes with Mac OS X; `brew install git` will give you a ‚ú®newer‚ú®, üçèfresherüçè
    version.
* Node
  * Version specified in `.nvmrc` file.
  * I recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to manage
    different node versions for various projects on the same machine.
  * We're going to keep reasonably updated with the latest Node version.

## Development
1. Clone this repository, and change directory into this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install everything
3. Run `npm run watch` to start webpack and the browser-sync server and start developing like it's a normal web app

## How to get Up and Running on a Phone
1. Run `npm install -g cordova` to install cordova
2. Run `cordova build` to build the App

### Android

#### Emulating Android
1. *Prerequisites:* Make sure you have [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)
installed. If you have [Brew Cask](https://caskroom.github.io/), just run `brew cask install
android-studio`.
2. You will also need an Android System Image, and an Emulator Image (AVD).

  1. Download desired System Image by running: `~/Library/Android/sdk/tools/android sdk`
  2. Create an AVD by running: `~/Library/Android/sdk/tools/android avd`

    HINT: For a faster emulator, use an Intel System Image and install the HAXM device driver.

3. Run `npm run android`

#### Running on a literal Android Phone
1. Plug in your phone
2. `cordova build`
3. `cordova run android`
